Edify Assistant

A hybrid chatbot that combines semantic search (fast FAQ lookup with TensorFlow.js) and an LLM fallback (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with KB grounding).

Frontend (chatbot.js)

Runs in the browser with TensorFlow.js + Universal Sentence Encoder.

Finds the closest KB entry and answers instantly if similarity ≥ threshold.

Backend (server.js)

Node/Express server with OpenAI API.

When no close KB match is found, the frontend POSTs to /ask.

The server embeds the user query, retrieves top-k KB entries, and calls GPT-4o-mini to answer grounded in the KB.

🚀 Features

🔎 Semantic search in browser → instant KB answers.

🧠 LLM fallback for out-of-scope questions.

📦 KB stored in JSON (kb.json) → single source of truth.

🔒 API key safe → only used on backend, never exposed to browser.

⚡ Hybrid design → cheap, fast, and still smart.

⚙️ Setup
1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edify-help-bot.git
cd edify-help-bot
npm install

2. Configure environment

Create a .env file in the root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-yourkeyhere
PORT=8787


(Keep .env secret! Add it to .gitignore.)

3. Run backend
node server.js


Should log:

Indexed <N> KB items.
LLM fallback server on :8787


Test health:

http://localhost:8787/health
→ { "ok": true }

4. Run frontend

Open public/index.html in a browser (or serve with Live Server / vite / any static server).

🧩 Usage

Ask a question that exists in KB (e.g., “how do I reset my password”).
→ Semantic search answers instantly.

Ask something random (“how do I cook a beef stew”).
→ Falls back to backend /ask, embeds + retrieves KB, and GPT-4o-mini replies with grounded context.

🔧 Config

Threshold: in chatbot.js

const THRESHOLD = 0.47;


Lower = fallback more often, higher = fallback less often.

Top-K retrieval: in server.js

function topK(queryEmb, k = 3) { ... }


Defaults to 3 KB entries per LLM request.

🛡️ Notes

Keep .env out of git. Share .env.example for setup.

kb.json is your single source of truth. You can expand it anytime.

Frontend only uses KB for local search; backend uses KB for retrieval + LLM context.

CORS is enabled in server.js → frontend and backend can run separately during dev.

🗺️ Roadmap

 Add support ticket creation for unanswered queries.

 Host both frontend + backend in one Express app to avoid CORS.

 Deploy backend (Render/Heroku) and serve frontend from same origin.

 Add analytics (track queries + hits/misses).
